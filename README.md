Qubes Split GPG configuration for qubes-gpg-server over TCP
===========================================================

This repository contains [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org) customizations to
support its [Split GPG](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/) setup using a
TCP connected qubes-gpg-server.

The scenario is originally created to support Split GPG with the
[USB armory](https://inversepath.com/usbarmory) device acting as GPG server,
however any networked device can be used for this setup.
